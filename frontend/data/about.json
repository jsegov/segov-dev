  "description": "My name is Jonathan Segovia, but most people just call me Segov. I'm a software engineer at Amazon, where I help automate content publishing at Prime Video. At Amazon my main focus has been building distributed backend systems and workflow automation tools that make complex pipelines run smoothly and scale reliably. Before that, I was a software engineer at Workday, where I helped build the Extend platform to improve the developer experience. I studied Computer Science at UCSB, where I first got hooked on building things that blend creativity and engineering.\n\nIf you want to read more about my work, check out the Career page. To see what I've been experimenting with lately, head to the Projects page or my GitHub. And if you'd rather chat with an AI version of me, you can always visit the AMA page."
