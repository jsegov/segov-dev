# Bug Fixes Report

This report documents 3 significant bugs found and fixed in the codebase, including logic errors, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities.

## Bug #1: SSR Hydration Mismatch in Analytics Component

**Location**: `components/analytics.tsx`  
**Type**: Client-side hydration bug  
**Severity**: Medium  

### Problem Description
The analytics component was using `localStorage.getItem()` in a `useEffect` without proper initialization, which caused hydration mismatches between server and client rendering. The component would start with `analyticsEnabled: false` on the server but could have a different value on the client after hydration, leading to React warnings and potential UI inconsistencies.

### Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: Direct access to localStorage during initial render without checking if the component is mounted
- **Impact**: React hydration warnings, potential flash of incorrect UI state
- **Risk Level**: Medium - affects user experience and console warnings

### Fix Applied
Added a mounting state (`isMounted`) to prevent hydration issues:

```typescript
const [isMounted, setIsMounted] = useState(false)

useEffect(() => {
  setIsMounted(true)
  const storedPreference = localStorage.getItem("analytics-enabled")
  if (storedPreference !== null) {
    setAnalyticsEnabled(storedPreference === "true")
  }
}, [])

// Don't render until component is mounted to prevent hydration mismatch
if (!isMounted) {
  return null
}
```

### Benefits
- Eliminates hydration mismatch warnings
- Ensures consistent UI state between server and client
- Follows React best practices for client-side only features

## Bug #2: Host Header Injection Vulnerability in Chatbot API

**Location**: `app/api/chatbot/route.ts`  
**Type**: Security vulnerability  
**Severity**: High  

### Problem Description
The chatbot API was constructing internal URLs using the `host` header from incoming requests without validation. This created a potential Host Header Injection vulnerability where an attacker could manipulate the host header to make the server send requests to malicious domains.

### Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: Blindly trusting the `host` header from client requests
- **Attack Vector**: Attacker could set malicious host header to redirect internal API calls
- **Impact**: Potential SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) attacks, data exfiltration
- **Risk Level**: High - security vulnerability

### Fix Applied
Implemented host validation with a whitelist approach:

```typescript
function getSafeBaseUrl(req: Request): string {
  // Use environment variable if available (recommended for production)
  if (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL) {
    return process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL;
  }
  
  // Fallback to constructing from request, but validate the host
  const host = req.headers.get('host') || 'localhost:3000';
  
  // Validate host to prevent header injection
  const allowedHosts = [
    'localhost:3000',
    'localhost:3001', 
    process.env.VERCEL_URL,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL
  ].filter(Boolean);
  
  if (!allowedHosts.some(allowedHost => host === allowedHost || host.endsWith(`.${allowedHost}`))) {
    console.warn(`[CHATBOT API] Potentially unsafe host header: ${host}`);
    // Default to localhost for development
    return process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'https://localhost' : 'http://localhost:3000';
  }
  
  const protocol = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'https' : 'http';
  return `${protocol}://${host}`;
}
```

### Benefits
- Prevents Host Header Injection attacks
- Adds logging for suspicious host headers
- Provides secure fallback for untrusted hosts
- Maintains functionality while improving security

## Bug #3: XSS Vulnerability in Rich Text Renderer

**Location**: `components/rich-text-renderer.tsx`  
**Type**: Security vulnerability (XSS)  
**Severity**: High  

### Problem Description
The rich text renderer was handling embedded assets and hyperlinks without properly sanitizing URLs. This could potentially lead to XSS attacks through malicious URLs using dangerous protocols like `javascript:`, `data:`, or other non-standard schemes.

### Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: No URL validation or sanitization for user-provided content
- **Attack Vector**: Malicious URLs in Contentful rich text content
- **Impact**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, code execution in user browsers
- **Risk Level**: High - security vulnerability

### Fix Applied
Implemented comprehensive URL sanitization:

```typescript
function sanitizeUrl(url: string): string | null {
  if (!url || typeof url !== 'string') return null;
  
  // Remove any whitespace
  url = url.trim();
  
  // Allow only safe protocols
  const allowedProtocols = ['http:', 'https:', 'mailto:', 'tel:'];
  const isRelativeUrl = url.startsWith('/') || url.startsWith('./') || url.startsWith('../');
  
  if (isRelativeUrl) {
    return url; // Relative URLs are generally safe
  }
  
  try {
    const urlObj = new URL(url);
    if (!allowedProtocols.includes(urlObj.protocol.toLowerCase())) {
      console.warn(`[RichTextRenderer] Blocked potentially unsafe URL protocol: ${urlObj.protocol}`);
      return null;
    }
    return url;
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn(`[RichTextRenderer] Invalid URL format: ${url}`);
    return null;
  }
}
```

Applied sanitization to both hyperlinks and embedded assets:
- Hyperlinks: Sanitized URIs, fallback to plain text for invalid URLs
- Embedded assets: Validated file URLs before rendering images or download links

### Benefits
- Prevents XSS attacks through malicious URLs
- Maintains functionality for legitimate content
- Provides logging for blocked URLs
- Graceful degradation for invalid URLs

## Summary

All three bugs have been successfully identified and fixed:

1. **Hydration Bug**: Fixed SSR/client state mismatch in analytics component
2. **Host Header Injection**: Secured API endpoint against header manipulation attacks  
3. **XSS Vulnerability**: Added URL sanitization to prevent malicious script execution

These fixes improve both the security posture and reliability of the application while maintaining existing functionality. The changes follow security best practices and include proper error handling and logging for monitoring purposes.

## Recommendations

1. **Security Audits**: Regular security reviews of user-input handling
2. **Environment Variables**: Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` in production for better security
3. **Content Security Policy**: Consider implementing CSP headers for additional XSS protection
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor logs for blocked URLs and suspicious host headers
