I've led the architecture and delivery of distributed microservices on AWS (Lambda, ECS Fargate, SQS/SNS, DynamoDB) that streamline how studio content is validated and released. My work has helped automate hundreds of quality checks, improve release reliability for ~600K customers, and reduce AWS costs by around $2M annually.
